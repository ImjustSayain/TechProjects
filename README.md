# Automated CI/CD Pipeline Project

A practical project demonstrating Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) principles using GitHub Actions. This pipeline automatically tests a simple web application and simulates a deployment process.

## 🚀 What It Does

-   **Automated Testing:** Uses a Python script to validate the content of an `index.html` file.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Leverages GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on every code push to the `main` branch.
-   **Simulated Deployment:** Includes a workflow step that prepares the application for deployment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **GitHub Actions:** For CI/CD workflow automation.
-   **Python:** For writing the test scripts.
-   **HTML:** For the sample web application.
-   **Git:** For version control.

## 📦 How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ImJustSayain
